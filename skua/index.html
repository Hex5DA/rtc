    <p style="text-align: center">
       hey!
       my name's will, but i commonly alias to <span class="text-grad">0x5DA</span> online.
    <p>

    <h2>in brief..</h2>
    <p>
    i'm <span class="text-grad">14</span> & have been coding for about 2 1/2 years. i use rust primarily now (and will shill it under contractual obligation :P), but have worked in java & python in the past.
    i use linux as my daily driver - currently using alpine - and spend most my time in the terminal (nvim). i don't game often, but when i do i enjoy Minecraft, Portal and Celeste.
    i like FLOSS & decentralisation, and try support them when i can. my current project is a programming language - though it's been on hold for embarrassingly long now ðŸ˜…
    in the future, i'm interested in learning some C / x86_64 and graphics.
    </p>

    <h2>projects..</h2>

    <p>
    * tumbleweed rolls across the screen *

    .. yeah, this one's embarrassingly sparse aha. for what it's worth, here's the list:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0">
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/JChatV3">JChatV3</a>: this was the first project i ever made! it was my 'final assignment' i set for myself when i learnt a little java in early 2021. it's more than shitty & i'm sure the code isn't much better, but i was proud of it when i made it!</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/DoubleFaceProgramming/2DMC">2DMC</a>: i contributed to a remake of <i>paper minecraft</i> a while ago with a friend. awesome project, and check out <a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/DaNubCoding">@DaNub</a> too!</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/note-taking-app">Note Taking Site</a>: i can't remember the context for this one, but suffice it to say i wanted to make a full stack note taking app. this was the result - built with svelte & rust</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/lmc">LMC emulator</a>: this is so primitive i'm not sure if it really counts as an 'emulator'. a simple rust <i>Little Man Computer</i> program, with a hacky-beyond-belief 'assembler' to load programs for it</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/shadow-lang">shadow</a>: a homebrew programming language. this is my latest project, though it's been abandoned for a while. i have a lot of ideas for it, the current syntax & compiler implementation isn't up to date by any means</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/dotfiles">do dotfiles count?</a> you be the judge Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p></li>
        <li><p><a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/hex5da.github.io">this site</a>: my little websi- what's that? this is too basic to qualify? well consider this: stfu i like it :)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>contacts..</h2>

    <p>if you're ever unlucky enough to have to talk to me, try this [embarassingly centralised] list:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0">
        <li><p>discord -> @0x5da</p></li>
        <li><p>fedi -> @0x5DA@fosstodon.org</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>(told you. i'm working on getting some more FLOSS friendly options on here soon!)</p>

    <h2>name..</h2>
    <p>
    adding this for clarification:
    my nick was <span class="text-grad">^-^ Trevor</span> for a <i>long</i> time. at the start of the new year, i changed it to its current <span class="text-grad">0x5DA</span> / <span class="text-grad">Hex5DA</span>.
    '<span class="text-grad">will</span>' is also fine (and much easier to say ðŸ˜‰).
    some aliases i used to use: <i>^-^ Trevor</i>, <i>tr3v0r</i>, <i>trevor</i>, <i>onlyTr3v0r</i>
    </p>

    <h2>setup..</h2>
    <p>
    i recently got a <span class="text-grad">ThinkPad T1440p</span> from <a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://minifree.org">minifree</a>. i absolutely love this thing (i defintely reccomend it!)
    i've installed <span class="text-grad">bedrock linux</span> with FDE and <i>alpine linux</i> as my primary strata.
    i use <i>spectrwm</i> as a window manager, utilising its default bar with a short script for system readouts.
    i spend most of my time in the terminal (TE: <i>URXVT</i>, SH: <i>zsh</i>), especially in <span class="text-grad">neovim</span> which i use as my primary editor. i try and keep my plugins & experience light and minimal, and though it's not perfect, i'm happy enough with it for now. my configs are all my own, with a modified neovim plugin for using my Xresources theme in the editor.
    you can find my dotfiles <a class="text-grad-underline" href="https://github.com/Hex5DA/dotfiles">here</a>!
